# Contributing to Ice

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Ice!

## How to Contribute

To contribute code or documentation to this project, please follow these steps:

1. If you're planning to make a significant contribution, such as a new feature
   or major changes, please discuss your ideas with the community first by
   starting a [discussion](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice/discussions) or by
   contacting us via email.

2. Fork this repository.

3. When implementing your contribution, please adhere to the project's naming
   and coding conventions to maintain consistency in the source code.

4. If your contribution requires changes to the test suite, please update it
   accordingly.

5. Submit a pull request.

6. If the CLA bot prompts you, sign the ZeroC Contributor Agreement.

We review carefully any contribution that we accept, and these reviews may take
some time. Please keep in mind there is no guarantee your contribution will be
accepted: we may reject a pull request for any reason, or no reason.

## Our Favorite Contributions

We prefer small contributions as they are easier to review and integrate. If
you want to contribute but don't know where to start, consider one of these
areas:

- New sample programs
  (in the [ice-demos](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice-demos) repository)

- Small bug fixes that affect only one or a few source files

- Fixes for the documentation

- Ports to new platforms and compilers

## Large Contributions

Please don't spend weeks or months on a new feature without checking with us
first!

Some contributions are troublesome and therefore difficult to accept:

- New features that require a new version of the Ice encoding or Ice protocol\
  For example, adding a new Slice type would most likely require a new version
  of the Ice encoding

- New features that may be useful for your project but are not obviously useful
  to other projects.\
  We want to keep our software lean and focused!

- Any update that breaks source compatibility with the most recent release
