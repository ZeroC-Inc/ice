The entries below contain brief descriptions of the changes in a release, in no
particular order. Some of the entries reflect significant new additions, while
others represent minor corrections. Although this list is not a comprehensive
report of every change we made in a release, it does provide details on the
changes we feel Ice users might need to be aware of.

We recommend that you use the release notes as a guide for migrating your
applications to this release, and the manual for complete details on a
particular aspect of Ice.
