% Current   Summary of Current
%
% Information about the current method invocation for servers. Each operation on the server has a
% Current as its implicit final parameter. Current is mostly used for Ice services. Most
% applications ignore this parameter.
%
% Current Properties:
%   adapter - The object adapter.
%   con - Information about the connection over which the current method invocation was received.
%   id - The Ice object identity.
%   facet - The facet.
%   operation - The operation name.
%   mode - The mode of the operation.
%   ctx - The request context, as received from the client.
%   requestId - The request id unless oneway (0).
%   encoding - The encoding version used to encode the input and output parameters.
