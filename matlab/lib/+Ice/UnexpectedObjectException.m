% UnexpectedObjectException   Summary of UnexpectedObjectException
%
% This exception is raised if the type of an unmarshaled Slice class instance does
% not match its expected type.
% This can happen if client and server are compiled with mismatched Slice
% definitions or if a class of the wrong type is passed as a parameter
% or return value using dynamic invocation. This exception can also be
% raised if IceStorm is used to send Slice class instances and
% an operation is subscribed to the wrong topic.
%
% UnexpectedObjectException Properties:
%   type_ - The Slice type ID of the class instance that was unmarshaled.
%   expectedType - The Slice type ID that was expected by the receiving operation.
