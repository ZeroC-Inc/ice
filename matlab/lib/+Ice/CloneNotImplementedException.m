% CloneNotImplementedException   Summary of CloneNotImplementedException
%
% An attempt was made to clone a class that does not support
% cloning.

% a class that is derived from an abstract Slice class (that is,
% a class containing operations), and the derived class does not
% provide an implementation of the ice_clone operation (C++ only).
