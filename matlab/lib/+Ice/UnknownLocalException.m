% UnknownLocalException   Summary of UnknownLocalException
%
% This exception is raised if an operation call on a server raises a
% local exception. Because local exceptions are not transmitted by
% the Ice protocol, the client receives all local exceptions raised
% by the server as UnknownLocalException. The only exception to this
% rule are all exceptions derived from RequestFailedException,
% which are transmitted by the Ice protocol even though they are
% declared local.
