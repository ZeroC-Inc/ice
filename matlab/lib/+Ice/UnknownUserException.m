% UnknownUserException   Summary of UnknownUserException
%
% An operation raised an incorrect user exception.
%
% This exception is raised if an operation raises a
% user exception that is not declared in the exception's
% throws clause. Such undeclared exceptions are
% not transmitted from the server to the client by the Ice
% protocol, but instead the client just gets an
% UnknownUserException. This is necessary in order to not violate
% the contract established by an operation's signature: Only local
% exceptions and user exceptions declared in the
% throws clause can be raised.
