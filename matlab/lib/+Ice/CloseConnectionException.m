% CloseConnectionException   Summary of CloseConnectionException
%
% This exception indicates that the connection has been gracefully shut down by the server. The operation call that
% caused this exception has not been executed by the server. In most cases you will not get this exception, because
% the client will automatically retry the operation call in case the server shut down the connection. However, if
% upon retry the server shuts down the connection again, and the retry limit has been reached, then this exception is
% propagated to the application code.
