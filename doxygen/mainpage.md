## Overview

This Slice API reference was generated from the Slice files in the
[zeroc-ice/ice GitHub repository](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice/tree/3.8/slice)
using [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/). We provide a [tag file](../slice.tag) if you
would like to include links to this documentation in your own Doxygen projects.

The [language mapping chapters](https://doc.zeroc.com/ice/3.8/language-mappings)
in the [Ice Manual](https://doc.zeroc.com/ice/3.8/introduction) describe how Slice
APIs map to programming language APIs.
